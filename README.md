# data-analysis-and-transformation-using-hive-lab

This repository showcases two significant projects, "Lab: Gaining Insight with Sentiment Analysis" and "Lab: Data Transformation with Hive," completed by Alexander Ashmore. These projects primarily involve data analysis and transformation using Hive, a powerful data warehousing and SQL-like query language designed for big data analytics.


### Introduction
In this project, we harness Hive's robust text processing capabilities to delve into customer comments and product ratings. The primary objective is to uncover potential issues, such as overcharged items, by analyzing customer feedback and ratings, which are often in unstructured free-form text format. Advanced text processing techniques are employed to extract meaningful insights from this data.

### Data Input Format
The original data input files consist of free-form text, accompanied by various product identification details.

## Sample SQL Queries
Here are some sample SQL queries utilized in these projects:

1. Calculate the average product rating for products with a minimum of 50 ratings.

2. Extract trigrams from customer messages for a specific product.

3. Retrieve distinct customer messages containing the keyword 'red' for a particular product.

4. Retrieve detailed product information based on a specific product ID.

5. Create a table named `cart_items` to store data about products added to shopping carts.

Feel free to explore the repository for comprehensive details and code related to these projects, including additional scripts and documentation.
